# ARM - Apriori Algorithm Explained with Coding

```{r}
#install.packages("arules")
#install.packages("arulesViz")
library(arules)
library(arulesViz)
```

We are now going to observe transactions in the form of an item matrix with 1338 rows and 7columns.

```{r}
df<-read.csv(file.choose())
df
```

## Data preparation:

It is important to note that ARM is typically used for categorical data, where items or attributes are binary (present/absent) or nominal (belonging to a set of categories). In this dataset, some of the attributes are numerical, such as age, bmi, children, and expenses.

To apply ARM on this dataset, you could first discretize the numerical attributes into categories. For example:

-   age groups (e.g., 18-25, 26-35, 36-45, etc.)

-   bmi categories (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese)

-   children categories (e.g., 0, 1-2, 3 or more)

-   Expenses criteria (e.g., low, medium, high).

### Stage:1 making age groups (e.g., 18-25, 26-35, 36-45, etc.)

```{r}
# create age groups
df$age_group <- cut(df$age, breaks = c(17, 30, 40, 50, 60, Inf), 
                            labels = c("18-30", "31-40", "41-50", "51-60", "60+"))
df
```

### Stage:2 making group based on bmi

By using World Health Organization (WHO) classification the BMI variable into several categories,

such as

-   under weight (BMI \< 18.5),

-   normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9),

-   over weight (BMI 25-29.9),

-   and obese (BMI \>= 30).

```{r}
df$bmi_group <- cut(df$bmi, breaks = c(0, 18.5, 24.9, 29.9, Inf),
                    labels = c("Under weight", "Normal weight", "Over weight", "Obese"))
df
```

### Stage:3 making group based on number of children

-   No children

-   1_child

-   2_children

-   3_children

-   4+\_children

```{r}
# Create a new column 'children_group'
df$children_group <- cut(df$children,
                                      breaks = c(-Inf, 0, 1, 2, 3, Inf),
                                      labels = c("No children", "1_child","2_children", "3_children", "4+_children"))

df

```

### Stage 4: based on expenses

-   low expenses,

-   medium-low expenses

-   medium-high expenses,

-   high expenses

```{r}
# Breaking the expenses based on quartiles of the expenses variable

expenses_break <- quantile(df$expenses, probs = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1))

# Discretize the expenses variable into four categories based on quartiles

df$expenses_group <- cut(df$expenses, breaks = expenses_break, labels = c("Low Expenses", "Medium-Low Expenses", "Medium-High Expenses", "High Expenses"))

df

```

After all changes the final dataset

```{r}
df
```

###Final data set contain only categorical value

In this dropping the all column which having numerical values

```{r}
#Dropping the column which having numerical value
df <- subset(df, select = -c(age, expenses, bmi,children))
df
```

## Performing ARM-Apiroir for different cases:

### case 1:

Analyzing the insurance dataset for the frequency of **smokers** in different regions can provide insights into the prevalence of smoking habits in those regions. Specifically, by focusing on individuals who smoke and reside in the **southeast, southwest, northwest, and northeast regions**, we can determine which regions have a higher incidence of smoking.

These findings can then be used to develop targeted smoking campaigns to reduce the incidence of smoking-related health issues in those regions and to promote healthier behaviors . Identifying the areas with high prevalence of smokers is a crucial step towards creating evidence-based policies and interventions to improve public health outcomes.

```{r}
# Create a subset of the data with only smoker=yes and the specified regions

case1_df<- subset(df, smoker == "yes" & region %in% c("southeast", "southwest", "northwest", "northeast"),select=c( "smoker","region"))

case1_df
```

```{r}

rule1 <- apriori(case1_df, parameter=list(suppor = 0.02, confidence = 0.8))

inspect(head(rule1,5))
```

```{r}
plot(rule1, method="graph")
```
